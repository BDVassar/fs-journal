SQL

tables are the base of sql databases.

adding db in repo

private readonly IDbConnection _db;
create constructor on the class.

inside get request.
string sql = @"
 SELECT
 *
 FROM cars;
";
List<Car> cars = _db.Query<Car>(sql).toList();
return cars;

delete is for rows, and drop is for the entire table.
