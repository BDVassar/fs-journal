## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
You can find answers all over the place when you are stuck. Google to try and find some code and make a solution, reach out to a colleague to see if they may have and idea of what to do. Collaboration among software developers is huge.
