# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
This week i felt like building my projects when pretty well. I was able to get a good flow and accomplish a lot. 
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
While Java and JavaScript are very different, they still have the same principles and logic to follow. 
- What are you struggling with?
Currently I am struggling just making little mistakes to my code and having to go back and debug them, also a lack of knowledge to do some of the things i want to do.
- What would you count as a victory?
It is starting to feel normal sitting in front of a computer and coding again. I have been feeling disconnected form coding since starting again. This week felt very fluid and i was able to flow.
