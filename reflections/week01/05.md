# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I feel like getting back into coding in general went well for me this week. I have not coded for about 2 years I think, but it already feels like I am as comfortable as I was then. 
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
I had no idea that extensions like bootstrap existed out there. Such a great tool! 
- What are you struggling with?
My lack of knowledge about CSS and HTML, but I am looking up and reading daily. I was feeling pretty scared about doing the mobile @media content for a little while. 
- What would you count as a victory?
Finishing CP-1 and not feeling like I was completely lost. I was able to create a lot of it without having to reference prior code or bootstrap documents. Once it got past the basics thought I was thrilled to have those resources at hand.
