# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
This week I was able to do a good job getting my website to look like the figma we were assigned. I tried to make sure I was able to recreate the project i was assigned as close as possible. 
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
to think about what data in your appstate is going to be. I was saving empty arrays as null and it was causing reactivity problems in vue. 
- What are you struggling with?
I was struggling with syntax and missing random little things this week. (I am sure time will improve this/ debugging will get better with time.)
- What would you count as a victory?
I was able to get my Duck!
