## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I have enjoyed my time at CodeWorks tremendously. I have come from knowing nothing about the languages and programs we started with and now feel comfortable enough to get a job. My concerns going into the final is going to be juggling the needs of my family with the time I need to get the project complete. I plan to work when I can focusing on completing one task at a time. I will set goal that i need to complete to finish the project on time. I have enjoyed learning something that has always interested in the way I learn bets(hands on).
