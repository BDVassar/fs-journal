# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
having and understanding of c# has gone well for me. I feel like I am starting to already use my references less.  
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
sql feels like it is to "easy", not that it is, but that the syntax is so short. 
- What are you struggling with?
still learning the syntax.
- What would you count as a victory?
was able to create a new project that I can see myself working on as a project after the course is complete.
