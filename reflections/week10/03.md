## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
A row of information contains a complete object and a column only contains specific properties on the objects. 
2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
CREATE TABLE characters(
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  age INT NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
) default charset utf8;

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
delete will remove and object and drop table will completely delete your table.
