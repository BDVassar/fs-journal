# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I felt like I was better able to do the logic in my head to solve problems. Feeling much more confident with my syntax in JavaScript. 
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
mvc was a nice surprise, although it took a little to get use to it is way more organized.
- What are you struggling with?
Knowledge for sure, remembering small syntax things and having to look at a lot of references in bootstrap.
- What would you count as a victory?
I have been able to work through and do the majority of my assignments without the use of references.(I look at them only if I have tried to fix something a min. of 2 times. )
