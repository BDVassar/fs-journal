# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I feel like creating the actual back-end went well for me. I enjoyed the logic and break form styling. 
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
That for the objectId to work there needs to be a virtual to address what you are looking for. 
- What are you struggling with?
linking the path in my head from the back end to the front end. I do not feel like I have a total understanding of the specifics. 
- What would you count as a victory?
After writing several Virtuals and getting some assistance from a TA I felt my understanding of Virtuals became much more clear.
