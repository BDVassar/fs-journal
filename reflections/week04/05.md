# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I am enjoying and doing well with the separation of information in our programs. 
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
That the async/await makes things much easier. It is nice to not have to write all of our own promises.
- What are you struggling with?
I struggled a little with the API's at first, but feel like I have come a log way since monday. 
- What would you count as a victory?
I was able to get my checkpoint completed even though I had a 4 day drive, and flight during the break. I did a little everyday and feel like i have maintained my coding process because of it.
